# WHAT IS THE RIGHT CODING LANGUAGE FOR YOU?

Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as there are many human-based languages, there are a variation of computer programming languages that we can use to communicate with a computer. The part of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary.” Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.” Each language has its own distinct features, though there are multiple commonalities between programming languages.

So if you are a beginner coder like I was this time last year, you will be truly overhwlmed with the variation of coding languages out there. How do I begin? Which language will be most useful to me? Well, I am here to help! 

This guide will focus on the 7 most popular coding languages, as for a beginner you want to learn a language that will open many opporunities for you, one that is popular in todays society, one that is still growing in functions. They are listed below in the order that I will explain them in, so scroll down accordingly to the one you would like to learn about. :)

  1. Python
  2. Java
  3. JavaScript
  4. C++
  5. C#
  6. HTML
  7. RUBY

# PYTHON

Python is an advanced programming language that is interpreted, object-oriented and built on flexible and robust semantics.

_Professions:_

Python developers, software engineers, back end developers, Python programmers
Used by employers in information technology, engineering, professional services and design

_Industries and Specialisations:_

Web and Internet development (frameworks, micro-frameworks and advanced content management systems); scientific and numeric computing; desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs)

_Organisations who use this language:_

Google, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, DropBox, NASA

_Features:_
* Simple to learn and easily read
* Associated web frameworks for developing web-based applications
* Free interpreter and standard library available in source or binary on major platforms

# JAVA

Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language with several features that make it ideal for web-based development.

_Professions:_

Software engineers, Java developers
Used by employers in communications, education, finance, health sciences, hospitality, retail and utilities

_Industries and Specialisations:_

Internet of Things (IoT), Enterprise Architecture, Cloud Computing

_Features:_

* Application portability
* Robust and interpreted language
* Extensive network library

# JAVASCRIPT

JavaScript is a client-side programming language that runs inside a client browser and processes commands on a computer rather than a server. It is commonly placed into an HTML or ASP file. Despite its name, JavaScript is not related to Java.

_Professions:_

JavaScript developers, Web developers, software engineers
Used by employers in Information Technology, Engineering, Design, Marketing, Finance and Healthcare
 
_Industries and Specialisations:_

Front End Website Development, Gaming Development

_Features:_

* Basic features are easy to learn
* Multiple frameworks
* Users can reference JQuery, a comprehensive Javascript library

# C++

C++ is a general purpose, object-oriented, middle-level programming language and is an extension of C language, which makes it possible to code C++ in a “C style”. In some situations, coding can be done in either format, making C++ an example of a hybrid language.

_Professions:_

C++ software engineers, C++ software developers, embedded engineers, programmer analysts
Used by employers in Information Technology, Engineering, Professional Services, Design, Quality Control and Management

_Industries and Specialisations:_

System/Application Software, Drivers, Client-Server Applications, Embedded Firmware

_Features:_

* Often the first programming language taught at college level
* Quick processing and compilation mechanism
* Robust standard library (STL)

FUN FACTS

! The Blackberry OS is developed using C++.

! The newest Microsoft Office suite was developed using C++

# C#

Pronounced C-sharp (not C-hashtag), C# is a multi-paradigm programming language that features strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented and component-oriented disciplines.

_Professions:_

C# developers, automation test engineers, software engineers, senior .net Web developers
Used by employers in Information Technology, Engineering, Design, Professional Services, Management and Quality Control

_Industries and Specialisations:_

Windows-based platforms

_Features:_

* Similar to Java in capabilities
* Ideal for beginners
* The go-to for working on Microsoft apps

# HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages; it ensures proper formatting of text and images (using tags) so that Internet browsers can display them in the ways they were intended to look.

_Professions:_

Web developers, technical editors, email designers, software engineers
Used by employers in Information Technology, Engineering, Design, Professional Services, Management, Marketing, Customer Services and Sales

_Industries and Specialisations:_

Web Development, Email Programming

_Features:_

Easy to use and learn the basics of HTML
Free and accessible
Multiple versions available

# RUBY

Ruby is an open-sourced, object-oriented scripting language that can be used independently or as part of the Ruby on Rails web framework.
Ruby is used for simulations, 3D modeling, and to manage and track information.

_Professions:_ 

Ruby on Rails developers, software engineers, data science engineers
Used by employers in technology, engineering, professional services, design, science and quality control

_Industries and Specialisations:_

Web App Development, Robotics, Networking, System Administration and Security

_Features:_

Free to use, copy, modify and distribute
Intuitive and flexible language
Completely object-oriented (ability to use method chaining)

FUN FACTS

! NASA uses Ruby to conduct simulations.

! Basecamp, Amazon, Twitter and Groupon were all created using Ruby on Rails
