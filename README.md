# WHAT IS THE RIGHT CODING LANGUAGE FOR YOU?

Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as there are many human-based languages, there are a variation of computer programming languages that we can use to communicate with a computer. The part of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary.” Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.” Each language has its own distinct features, though there are multiple commonalities between programming languages.

So if you are a beginner coder like I was this time last year, you will be truly overhwlmed with the variation of coding languages out there. How do I begin? Which language will be most useful to me? Well, I am here to help! 

This guide will focus on the 7 most popular coding languages, as for a beginner you want to learn a language that will open many opporunities for you, one that is popular in todays society, one that is still growing in functions. They are listed below in the order that I will explain them in, so scroll down accordingly to the one you would like to learn about. :)

  1. Python
  2. Java
  3. JavaScript
  4. C++
  5. C#
  6. HTML
  7. RUBY

# PYTHON

Python is an advanced programming language that is interpreted, object-oriented and built on flexible and robust semantics.

_Professions:_

Python developers, software engineers, back end developers, Python programmers
Used by employers in information technology, engineering, professional services and design

_Industries and Specialisations:_

Web and Internet development (frameworks, micro-frameworks and advanced content management systems); scientific and numeric computing; desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs)

_Organisations who use this language:_

Google, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, DropBox, NASA

_Features:_
* Simple to learn and easily read
* Associated web frameworks for developing web-based applications
* Free interpreter and standard library available in source or binary on major platforms

# JAVA

Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language with several features that make it ideal for web-based development.

_Professions:_

Software engineers, Java developers
Used by employers in communications, education, finance, health sciences, hospitality, retail and utilities

_Industries and Specialisations:_

Internet of Things (IoT), Enterprise Architecture, Cloud Computing

_Features:_

* Application portability
* Robust and interpreted language
* Extensive network library

# JAVASCRIPT

JavaScript is a client-side programming language that runs inside a client browser and processes commands on a computer rather than a server. It is commonly placed into an HTML or ASP file. Despite its name, JavaScript is not related to Java.

_Professions:_

JavaScript developers, Web developers, software engineers
Used by employers in Information Technology, Engineering, Design, Marketing, Finance and Healthcare
 
_Industries and Specialisations:_

Front End Website Development, Gaming Development

_Features:_

* Basic features are easy to learn
* Multiple frameworks
* Users can reference JQuery, a comprehensive Javascript library

# C++

C++ is a general purpose, object-oriented, middle-level programming language and is an extension of C language, which makes it possible to code C++ in a “C style”. In some situations, coding can be done in either format, making C++ an example of a hybrid language.

_Professions:_

C++ software engineers, C++ software developers, embedded engineers, programmer analysts
Used by employers in Information Technology, Engineering, Professional Services, Design, Quality Control and Management

_Industries and Specialisations:_

System/Application Software, Drivers, Client-Server Applications, Embedded Firmware

_Features:_

* Often the first programming language taught at college level
* Quick processing and compilation mechanism
* Robust standard library (STL)

FUN FACTS
! The Blackberry OS is developed using C++.
! The newest Microsoft Office suite was developed using C++

# C#

Pronounced C-sharp (not C-hashtag), C# is a multi-paradigm programming language that features strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented and component-oriented disciplines.

_Professions:_

C# developers, automation test engineers, software engineers, senior .net Web developers
Used by employers in Information Technology, Engineering, Design, Professional Services, Management and Quality Control
