# WHAT IS THE RIGHT CODING LANGUAGE FOR YOU?

Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as there are many human-based languages, there are a variation of computer programming languages that we can use to communicate with a computer. The part of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary.” Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.” Each language has its own distinct features, though there are multiple commonalities between programming languages.

So if you are a beginner coder like I was this time last year, you will be truly overhwlmed with the variation of coding languages out there. How do I begin? Which language will be most useful to me? Well, I am here to help!
